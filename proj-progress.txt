General:
Upon execution, if no entry for the day has been inputted ask for the quality of each
topic and save those to a file. If entry has been entered for the day, output message 
indicating that entry has been entered already. The program will have to read the time, 
day, and status of entry at the beginning of execution before prompting user input. 
On saturday - after 7 entries have been entered - the program will present plotted data 
with data analyses like averages, what and how many good days there were, highest and 
lowest rated days, and what areas of improvement are needed(?) The program should also 
be aware of any skipped days. If days are skipped, then it should just roll over to the 
next day.

02/03/2022 ==============
I need to think in depth as to how the program reads and writes - specifically the stream of data.
Perhaps I can have the stream of data written as:
    02/03/2022 a b c d e f g
    [date] [rate 1] [rate 2] [rate 3] ... [rate n]
Then the program would have to read the date only, then compare to the current date. 

Afterwards within the same line, input the ratings asked by the program. 

01/10/2022 ==============
I neeed to figure out one of the two: have the program read from the bottom of the file
or append to the beginning of the file. 
Note: there will be text between dates for the ratings. So that will influence where I
read from in the file. 
[x] Read date and report date
[x] Write to file
