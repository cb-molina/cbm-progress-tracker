Weekly Progress Tracker ========================= 01/06/2022
Language: CPP or Python
Summary: a program that records my progress throughout time. I'm thinking of something along the lines of a rating system on the scale from 1 to 5 for general topics like satisfaction, productiveness, quality of day, sense of control, expectations, quality of sleep.

Technical: Upon execution, if no entry for the day has been inputted ask for the quality of each topic and save those to a file. If entry has been entered for the day, output message indicating that entry has been entered already. The program will have to read the time, day, and status of entry at the beginning of execution before prompting user input. 
On saturday - after 7 entries have been entered - the program will present plotted data with data analyses like averages, what and how many good days there were, highest and lowest rated days, and what areas of improvement are needed(?)
The program should also be aware of any skipped days. If days are skipped, then it should just roll over to the next day.
